        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

          <li>Common elements that add content to pages:

            Text elements, Image elements, Header elements, and List elements.
            
            In addition to elements that can be seen on the page, elements are also used 
            to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and 
            other developers.</li>
          <li>Common element types that divide and describe a page are
            
            Meta-related elements, Content division elements, and Semantic elements.</li>
          <li>The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.

              The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
              <li>HTML is the framework of your code</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a free, open source version control system that allows web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work. It also allows developers 
            to revert to previous versions of the code if a problem is discovered.</li>
          <li>GitHub is the largest provider of internet hosting for software and web development code, and provides the version control functionality of Git in a central repository.</li>

            <li>    1. Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
            <li>    2. APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.</li> 
             <li>   3. Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.</li>
