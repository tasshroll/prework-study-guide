To record notes of things I learned in pre-work about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript

This project was built to assist a bootcamp student by listing out key information learned during pre-work.
- What problem does it solve?
Creating this project allows a student learning web development to understand the key features of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and view some code.

I learned how HTML code in an index file can link to a CSS stle sheet to make the website design pretty. In addition, the JavaScript allows a dynamic interface for the user.

## Usage
This webpage lists these topics: HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScrript along with some notes under each element. Looking at the code that generates these elements is useful for a bootcamp student. When we open the Chrove DevTools console, we can see the output that the JavaScript creates as it runs. The output will list the four topics and randomly choose a topic for  us to study first.
